# nettradio
Very simple network radio. Made for listening to NRK (nrk.no) on a raspberry. Can be set to work with any station
that have available mp3-streams for their channels.

Copy the shell script to /usr/local/bin and the php file to anywhere it can be picked up by your web server. Feel
free to rename the php-file.
